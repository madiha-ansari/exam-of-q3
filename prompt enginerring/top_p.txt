Q1. What is the other name for Top-p?
a) Beam Search
b) Greedy Search
c) Nucleus Sampling
d) Random Sampling
Answer: c) Nucleus Sampling ✅

Q2. What does Top-p depend on?
a) Fixed number of words
b) Equal chance for all words
c) Cumulative probability threshold
d) Ignoring all words
Answer: c) Cumulative probability threshold ✅

Q3. If Top-p = 1.0, what will happen?
a) Only one word is always chosen
b) No restriction, all possible words are considered
c) Only the least likely words are chosen
d) Output becomes 100% deterministic
Answer: b) No restriction, all possible words are considered ✅

Q4. Which Top-p value makes the output more predictable and less random?
